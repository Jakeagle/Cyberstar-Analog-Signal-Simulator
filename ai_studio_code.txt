# 🔧 Final Optimization: Archive-Grade Signal Engine

## 1. Implement Sub-Sample Bit Timing
To prevent "Frame Drift" (which causes the Rolfe Christmas Tree bug), do not round bit samples. Use an accumulator to track the exact timing of the 4800 Baud clock.
- **Samples per bit:** 9.1875
- **Goal:** Ensure the TDM frame (96 bits) ends exactly at sample 882 (44100 / 50Hz).

## 2. Implement "High-Frequency Screech" (BMC Logic)
Update the `generateBMCSignal` function:
- **Every Bit:** Toggle the signal at the start of the bit period.
- **If Bit is '1':** Toggle the signal AGAIN exactly halfway through the bit period (at sample 4.5).
- **If Bit is '0':** Do NOT toggle in the middle.
- **Waveform:** Use a hard `1.0` and `-1.0` (Square Wave).

## 3. Strict TD/BD Track Isolation
Ensure the Stereo output is hard-panned according to the RFE Spec:
- **LEFT CHANNEL (TD):** Only generate bits defined in the TD BitMap (Rolfe, Dook, Fats, Earl).
- **RIGHT CHANNEL (BD):** Only generate bits defined in the BD BitMap (Beach Bear, Mitzi, Billy Bob).
- **Zero-Padding:** If a bit is not defined in the bitmap, it MUST be a logical '0' (2400Hz tone), not silence.

## 4. The "Rolfe Seizure" State-Lock
Inside the `update` loop:
- Store the `previousBitState` for every character.
- Only trigger the UI LED and the System Log if `currentBitState !== previousBitState`.
- This will stop the log spam and the flickering.

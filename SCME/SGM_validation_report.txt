CYBERSTAR HARDWARE EMULATOR -- FAILURE REPORT
====================================================
Generated  : 2026-02-27 11:15:48
File       : Hip_to_be_square_-_Decoder_test_4ch.wav
Sample Rate: 48000 Hz  (4-channel legacy Cyberstar format)

RESULT: FAIL

Reason (TD track):
  - Frame sync: NO LOCK
  - Blank-bit integrity: 80.3%  (required >= 98.0%)

Reason (BD track):
  - Frame sync: NO LOCK
  - Blank-bit integrity: 91.2%  (required >= 98.0%)

Root cause:
  The WAV was generated by the old Web Audio API export pipeline.
  The output did not conform to the BMC frame structure expected
  by the hardware. Frame boundaries could not be established on
  either the TD or BD control tracks. This file would be rejected
  by physical Cyberstar hardware.

Next step:
  Re-export using the Python SCME/SGM pipeline (BMCEncoder +
  FrameBuilder). Python-generated output passed 100% of internal
  validation tests and produces hardware-conformant BMC frames.
